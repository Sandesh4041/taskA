"I have implemented this using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no frameworks. One limitation is usability on small screens: sliders may not function as well on mobile devices due to limited space for precise manipulation. A future improvement could be optimizing the design for responsiveness, ensuring sliders are easy to use and adjust on smaller screens and touch interfaces."
